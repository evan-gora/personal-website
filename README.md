# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# About the Project

This project was created because I wanted to learn more about web development, as well as have a place to store any future projects. This website was a great learning experience,
as I had no prior experience using HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. I followd a tutorial for getting everything set up with React, as well as for the basic design of the website. *This design is not my own*. I simply modified the design to make it more personalized, and updated my experiences and projects to match my own.
