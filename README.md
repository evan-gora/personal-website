# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# About the Project

This is a project I created as a way to learn more about front-end development. It is a good way for users to access any information about my interests, skills,
or projects. This was a challenge for me, as I had never done any front-end development before, so I had to learn React, HTML, and CSS while I was working on this 
project. The design for the website came from a tutorial I was loosely following, and I edited it slightly to make it look more how I liked it.
